Harmony is an open blockchain with data sharding and fast finality. Social games and community AI can use our onchain tokens for micro-payments, smart contracts for market pricing, and zero-knowledge proofs for data privacy.

Harmonyâ€™s mission is to scale trust and create a radically fair economy. Our platform is decentralized, scalable and secure to settle any transactions without trusted parties.

ðŸš€ Building a (Rocket)Ship
We are a Day-1 startup. Blockchains are becoming the foundation of the global economy, yet their adoption is at only 1%. That means that you as a pioneer and developer are shaping the future with 10X impact. Harmony is a community-driven project, a network with hundreds of applications, and a team wearing crazy ambitions on their sleeves. Because the invincible summer awaits!

For engineers, we value your deep understanding of how bytes work. You are a tool maker, a system hacker, and a math nerd all in ONE. Your typical day involves prototyping a top-conference research paper, debugging and profiling in hexdecimal, or writing updates to coordinate asynchronously with tens of engineers in the open. Building a blockchain is like jumping off the cliff while assembling the plane engine on the fly â€“ but, if you can thrive in chaos, why NOT?

For creatives, we approve your obsession with user experience. You are a product designer, a brand manager, and an industry analyst all in ONE. Your typical day involves studying what delights and what hurts through hard metrics, writing long-form narratives on the why's and the do's, or scrumming tasks for a product launch to iterate with millions of users. Building a community is like sharing your blue heart while keeping the culture alive for decades â€“ but, if this is your dream of 50 years, start NOW?
