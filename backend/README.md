### Working directory

Unless otherwise specified, use `/backend` as your current working directory

See below for execution settings. You may also use .env for environment variables

### Initialize Python virtual environment

First, make sure [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is installed. Then, use the setup script at the working directory: `/backend`

```
./setup.sh
```

### Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Initialize database schemas

```
python manage.py migrate 
```


### Development

First, generate a self-signed certificate:

```
cd certs
./gen.sh
```

Then go back to the working directory. Use `dev.sh` for running HTTPS server, and `dev-http.sh` for HTTP server.

### Production

#### Install systemctl service

TODO

#### With nginx

Use `./run-http.sh`

#### Without nginx (not recommended)

First, make sure `certs/https.crt` and `certs/https.key` are soft-linked to appropriate CA-signed certificates, such as ones generated by Lego

Then, make sure `python` binary can access lower ports (such as using `libcap2-bin`) if you intend to use production ports (443). 

Then, use `./run.sh`

### User management

Create admin account:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You can use admin account to login at a running server to create user accounts and access tokens via the UI
